    <div id="about">
        <div id="d1"><p>I grew up in a small city in North Macedonia. The people I met and the dynamic lifestyle I
            chased have profoundly shaped who I am today. The community offered little so the people had to fill in the
            void with conversations and character. Thus, the city holds a special place in my heart as it provided the
            backdrop for my formative years. From a young age, I was exposed to diverse individuals, late night
            wonderings, and perspectives, fostering a curiosity and open-mindedness that continue to guide my personal
            growth.</p></div>
        <div id="d2"><p>I love psychology and reading philosophical books about our inner self and morality. As an
            individualistic person, I thrive on expressing my unique perspective and forging my own path. I firmly
            believe in the power of individuality and the importance of staying true to myself, even when faced with
            societal pressures or expectations. This authenticity drives me to embrace my strengths, quirks, and
            passions, allowing me to stand out in whatever it is I do and have my own morals and motives behind every
            action.</p></div>
        <div id="d3"><p>There's a fire within me that ignites when faced with a challenge, a thrilling rush that courses
            through my veins. I am a person who revels in the exhilaration of pushing boundaries and testing my limits.
            Challenges, be they mental or physical, awaken a vibrant energy within me, propelling me forward on a path
            of growth and self-discovery. The allure of the unknown beckons me, as I eagerly embrace the opportunity to
            step outside my comfort zone and confront obstacles head-on.</p></div>
